# Novela — A Gatsby theme by Narative

With minimal styling and maximum features — including multiple homepage layouts, built-in social sharing and dark mode — Novela makes it easy to start publishing beautiful articles and stories with Gatsby.

Novela was built by the team at [Narative](https://www.narative.co), and built for everyone that loves the web.

Special thanks to [@narative](https://github.com/narative) for this awesome project and
